Part One: Determining experimental parameters

Set in RunIDNetRMD.m
- Simulation time
– Number of neurons
– Number of columns/stripes
– Synapse parameter regime (true_field) – e.g. CaMKII_Grin1_50, which refers to abolition of the NMDA current in 50% of postsynaptic excitatory neurons

Set in SetCRISPRparams.m
– Details of synapse parameter regime – weights for AMPA, NMDA, and GABA for each synapse type
– dtax (meaning unknown), failure probability, and 

Part Two: Running simulations for a set of parameters

Part Three: Analyzing outputs of a single simulation and producing single-run figures

Outputs:

Part Four: Combined analysis of multiple simulations and generating summary figures
